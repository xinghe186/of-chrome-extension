### :hammer_and_wrench: Installation

1. Download this extension as a [ZIP file from GitHub](https://github.com/xinghe186/of-chrome-extension/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Unzip the file and you should have a folder named `chrome-extension-main`
3. Visit the URL `chrome://extensions` and enable `Developer mode`
4. Drag and drop the `of-chrome-extension-main` folder anywhere onto the extensions page to install it (do not delete the folder afterwards)

### :thinking: Why not from the Chrome Web Store?

This extension has been in the Chrome Web Store for almost 4 years and has been installed by more than 100k+ users. Unfortunately, it has been removed from the store due to its potential use with adult content.

### :thinking: Is it safe?

We have open-sourced the Onlyfans-downloader extension and anyone can take a look at the source code for full transparency.
